# How to customize the appointment height in the schedule view of the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to customize the appointment height in the schedule view of the Flutter Calendar.

The [appointmentItemHeight](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ScheduleViewSettings/appointmentItemHeight.html) property of the [ScheduleViewSettings](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ScheduleViewSettings-class.html) in the Flutter Event Calendar can be used to customise the height of the appointment in schedule view. You can hide the week with no appointments by using the [hideEmptyScheduleWeek](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ScheduleViewSettings/hideEmptyScheduleWeek.html) property of the ScheduleViewSettings.
